#TODO

1. [-] Vaccine implementation
2. ABC / param exploration
3. Contact matrix subsection
4. Email Kiesha
5. Basic scientific adequacy question
6. [x] main_sim input adjusted mortality argument
7. SO ODE question for separating outflows/aging etc
8. Lambda switcher
9. Vx impact pathway
10. Move output to named folders

Minimum outputs

1. Baseline target fits
2. Baseline analysis plots - incidence disaggregation
3. Vaccine incidence disaggregation
4. Vaccine incidence/mortality reduction
5. R_0 plot
6.

### Required plots

1. Baseline calibration plots

Comparison plots

1. Incidence diff - longitudinal
2. Mortality diff - longitudinal



#TOCLEAN

1. Better parameter passing

#Simplifications

1. TSR
2. In general, public private mixing simplified
3. Targets

#Presentation

1. Construct the transmission term equation

#Outputs

1. Dynamic R0 matrix
2. Evolving contact matrices

# Add

1. Flow coefficient matrix
2. Clean up TSR array

# Notes on age bins / trigenerational

- Intergenerational mixing is more household - so if the household contribution is small, then the dilution of the intergenerational contact signal is hopefully small.
